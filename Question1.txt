Q1. Create an arrow function called square that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. Use
the arrow function to calculate the square of a given number and display the result.

Solution:


Sure! Here's how you can create an arrow function called `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns its square. Additionally, the code will calculate the square of a given number and display the result.

### Arrow Function for Squaring a Number
```javascript
const square = (num) => num * num;
```

### Using the Arrow Function
```javascript
let number = 5; // You can change this number to any value you want to test
let result = square(number);
console.log(`The square of ${number} is ${result}`);
```

### Explanation
1. Arrow Function Definition:
    - `const square = (num) => num * num;` defines an arrow function `square` that takes one parameter `num` and returns the value of `num` multiplied by itself.

2. Using the Arrow Function:
    - `let number = 5;` initializes a variable `number` with the value 5.
    - `let result = square(number);` calls the `square` function with `number` as an argument and stores the result in the variable `result`.
    - `console.log(`The square of ${number} is ${result}`);` outputs the result to the console.

### Complete Code Example
```javascript
const square = (num) => num * num;

let number = 5; // You can change this number to any value you want to test
let result = square(number);
console.log(`The square of ${number} is ${result}`);
```

### Output
For `number = 5`, the output will be:
```
The square of 5 is 25
```

You can change the value of `number` to test the function with different inputs and see the corresponding squared values.
