Question 1: Create an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that calculates the square of a number and  immediately displays the result.

Solutiion: 

    An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is defined and immediately executed. Here's how you can create an IIFE in JavaScript that calculates the square of a number and immediately displays the result:

### Syntax of IIFE
The general syntax of an IIFE is:

javascript
(function() {
    // function body
})();


You can also pass parameters to an IIFE:

javascript
(function(param) {
    // function body using param
})(argument);


### Example IIFE to Calculate the Square of a Number

Here's an example where we calculate the square of a number (e.g., 5) and immediately display the result:

javascript
(function(number) {
    let square = number * number;
    console.log(`The square of ${number} is ${square}.`);
})(5);


### Explanation
1. **IIFE Declaration and Invocation**:
    - `(function(number) { ... })(5);` defines an anonymous function that takes one parameter `number` and immediately invokes it with the argument `5`.

2. **Calculating the Square**:
    - Inside the IIFE, the square of the `number` is calculated using `number * number` and stored in the variable `square`.

3. **Displaying the Result**:
    - The result is then displayed using `console.log`.

### Running the Code

When you run the above code, the following output will be immediately displayed:


The square of 5 is 25.


You can change the argument `5` to any other number to calculate and display its square immediately. For example:

javascript
(function(number) {
    let square = number * number;
    console.log(`The square of ${number} is ${square}.`);
})(7);


This will output:


The square of 7 is 49.


This way, the IIFE allows you to perform the calculation and display the result immediately.
